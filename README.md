Problem Statement:
Creating a non-airline specific online portal for flight booking.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to create an airline booking portal to facilitate airline
reservations.
A user first makes his/her own account and then is entitled to make a booking for himself or
other persons under his/her user id.

Project Overview:
The project aims at making a portal to book flights by anyone.
Based on the user’s choice of origin, destination and date, the booking begins. Further the user
is asked for his/her choice of flight from various airlines with different departure and arrival
times.
The booking is completed after getting the personal information from the user and deducting
the fare of the flight from the user’s wallet.
